    <h1>HEADING</h1>
    <p>A<i> computer is described </i>as an electronic device because;
         it is made up of electronic components and uses electric
          energy (such as electricity) to operate.</p>
    <p>A <u>computer has an internal memory,</u> which stores data & instructions
        <em> temporarily awaiting processing,</em> and even holds the intermediate
          result (information) before it is communicated to the recipients 
          through the Output devices.</p>
    <p>It <b>works on the data using the</b> instructions issued, means that, the
         computer cannot do any useful job on its own. It can only work as
          per the set of instructions issued.
    <p>A <s>computer will accept data in one form</s> and produce it in another form.
         The data is normally held within the computer as it is being processed.</p>
